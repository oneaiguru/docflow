# AZ_hope Project Analysis

The `AZ_hope` repository contains a Node.js library written mostly in CoffeeScript. The package name in `package.json` is `dscommon3`, suggesting it is part of a larger project called **DSCommon**.

Key modules located under `src` provide utilities for working with document definitions and validations:

- **result** – collects errors/warnings with context (`src/result/_result.coffee`).
- **bitArray** – implements a bit array data structure (`src/bitArray.coffee`).
- **flatMap** and **sortedMap** – process nested data structures and build flattened indexes (`src/flatMap.coffee`, `src/sortedMap.coffee`).
- **loader** – loads document definitions from files such as `docs`, `types`, `rights`, and `validators` (`src/loader.coffee`).
- **reporter** – integrates with Jasmine for custom reporting (`src/reporter.coffee`).
- **utils** – collection of helper functions for validation and cloning objects (`src/utils/*`).

Build scripts under `scripts/` rely on a custom build system and compile CoffeeScript sources to JavaScript, run Jasmine tests, and generate documentation with Docco.

Documentation generated with Docco is stored under `docco/` and includes detailed Russian comments explaining each component.

Overall, the project provides infrastructure for describing document types, validating them, and running tests using Jasmine. The build script expects additional utilities (e.g., `server/src/common/build`) which are not included in this repository.
